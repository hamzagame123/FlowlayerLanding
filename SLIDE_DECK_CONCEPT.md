## Overview

## Slide Deck Structure

### SECTION 1: HOOK (Slides 1-3)

#### Slide 1: Title Slide
**Content:**
- FlowLayer logo (◈ symbol)
- "Route by How You Feel"
- Tagline: "Reimagining navigation for the emotional era"
- Subtle gradient animation background
- Year: 2025

**Speaker Notes:**
> Open with intrigue. This isn't just another navigation app — it's a paradigm shift in how we think about getting from A to B.

---

#### Slide 2: The Question
**Content:**
- Large text: "What if navigation understood..."
- Reveal: "...not just WHERE you want to go"
- Reveal: "...but HOW you want to feel when you get there?"
- Background: Abstract road/path visualization

**Speaker Notes:**
> Pause after each reveal. Let the audience sit with this concept. Most have never considered their emotional state as a routing factor.

---

#### Slide 3: The Insight
**Content:**
- Quote in large typography:
  > "The fastest route isn't always the best route."
- Attribution: User Research Insight
- Visual: Split image — stressed highway driving vs. peaceful scenic route

**Speaker Notes:**
> This is the foundational insight that sparked FlowLayer. We've all experienced this — being rushed through an unpleasant route when we would have preferred a different experience.

---

### SECTION 2: THE PROBLEM (Slides 4-7)

#### Slide 4: Section Divider
**Content:**
- Large "02" in outline text
- "The Problem"
- Icon: 😤

---

#### Slide 5: Pain Point Overview
**Content:**
- Headline: "Navigation apps are emotionally blind"
- Four pain points with icons:
  - 😤 **One-Size-Fits-All** — Treats all drivers the same
  - 😰 **Stress Amplification** — Fastest = most stressful
  - 🏃 **Journey Ignored** — Only destination matters
  - 🤖 **No Emotional IQ** — Context is irrelevant

**Visual Treatment:**
- Each pain point appears sequentially
- Use contrasting red/orange tones for problem slides

**Speaker Notes:**
> Walk through each pain point. Ask the audience: "How many of you have experienced this?" Build empathy before presenting the solution.

---

#### Slide 6: Research Data
**Content:**
- Headline: "What drivers told us"
- Three stat cards with animations:
  - **67%** — Report navigation-related stress weekly
  - **43%** — Would take a longer route for a better experience
  - **89%** — Want navigation that understands preferences

**Visual Treatment:**
- Stats animate in with counter effect
- Use data visualization (circular progress, bar charts)

**Speaker Notes:**
> These aren't made-up numbers. This is what real drivers are telling us. There's a massive unmet need in the market.

---

#### Slide 7: The Gap Visualization
**Content:**
- Diagram showing:
  - Left: "What navigation optimizes for" → Time, Distance
  - Right: "What humans care about" → Experience, Mood, Context, Memories
  - Center: Big GAP indicator

**Speaker Notes:**
> This visual makes the problem crystal clear. Current apps optimize for metrics, not humans.

---

### SECTION 3: THE SOLUTION (Slides 8-15)
